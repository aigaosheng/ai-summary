1.\\nAnnouncing this on Sunday, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said letters will be sent in October to those who are currently not insured, telling them what they may need to do.\\nOthers will be informed when it's time to renew their current insurance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore On This Topic\\n\\n \\n\\nHokkien video on Medishield Life for pioneers gets more than 300k views in 3 days\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, every household will be sent a MediShield Life booklet in four languages giving them details of the scheme.\\nMediShield Life will provide everyone - both sick and healthy - with lifetime health insurance cover. \\nCoverage will be higher with lower co-payments and no lifetime claim caps, but premiums will be higher than the current scheme.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Government has assured that this scheme will be made highly affordable with Government aid of about $4 billion over five years being pumped in. There will also be transitional subsidies which will be given to everyone for the first four years.\\n\\nOn top of that, two in three people will also get 15-50 per cent permanent subsidies on their premiums. Additional help will be given to those who still can't afford the premiums.\\nFor the majority, the higher premiums will be entirely covered by Medisave.\\nOn Friday (July 31), it was announced that the 12-member MediShield Life Council had been set up to ensure the scheme's smooth launch. \\nFor the answers to 101 frequently asked questions about the scheme, click here. \\nReaders can also contact ST's Health Correspondent Salma Khalik and view the questions posed to her here. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMediShield Life\\n\\nMediSave\\n\\nMinistry of Health\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore\\n\\nWhatsapp\\nLinkedin\\nTwitter\\nFB Messenger\\nEmail\\nPrint\\nPurchase Article\\n\\nCopy permalink\\n\\nhttps://str.sg/3vSw\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead this subscriber-only article for free!\\nJust sign up for a free account and log in to continue reading.\\n\\nMediShield Life to start on Nov 1\\n\\nSign up\\n\\nAlready have an account?
