Alibaba Group Announces December Quarter 2023 Results 
Hangzhou, China, February 7, 2024 – Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA and HKEX: 9988 
(HKD Counter) and 89988 (RMB Counter), “Alibaba” or “Alibaba Group”) today announced its financial 
results for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. 
“We delivered a solid quarter as we are executing our focused strategies across the organization. Our top 
priority is to reignite the growth of our core businesses, e-commerce and cloud computing. We will step up 
investment to improve users’ core experiences to drive growth in Taobao and Tmall Group and strengthen 
market leadership in the coming year. We will also focus our resources on developing public cloud products 
and sustaining the strong growth momentum in international commerce business,” said Eddie Wu, Chief 
Executive Officer of Alibaba Group.  
“Alibaba Group delivered a healthy quarter with revenue growth of 5% year-over-year. We increased our 
investment in strategic priorities and improved shareholder return by leveraging our strong balance sheet and 
cash flow. Our board of directors approved an increase of US$25 billion to our share repurchase program, 
demonstrating our confidence in the outlook of our business and cash flow. Our consistent share repurchase 
has also reduced outstanding share count while achieving EPS and cash flow per share accretion,” said Toby 
Xu, Chief Financial Officer of Alibaba Group. 
 
BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS  
 
In the quarter ended December 31, 2023: 
• Revenue was RMB260,348 million (US$36,669 million), an increase of 5% year-over-year.   
 
• Income from operations was RMB22,511 million (US$3,171 million), a decrease of 36% year-
over-year. The year-over-year decrease was primarily attributable to impairment of intangible assets 
of Sun Art and impairment of goodwill of Youku. Adjusted EBITA, a non-GAAP measurement 
(excluding share-based compensation expense, impairment of intangible assets and goodwill and 
certain other items), increased 2% year-over-year to RMB52,843 million (US$7,443 million).  
 
• Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was RMB14,433 million (US$2,033 million). 
Net income was RMB10,717 million (US$1,509 million), a decrease of 77% or RMB35,029 million 
year-over-year, primarily attributable to mark-to-market changes from our equity investments and 
the decrease in income from operations due to the impairment as mentioned above. Excluding share-
based compensation expense, gains/losses of investments, impairment of intangible assets and 
goodwill, and certain other items, non-GAAP net income in the quarter ended December 31, 2023 
was RMB47,951 million (US$6,754 million), a decrease of 4% compared to RMB49,932 million in 
the same quarter of 2022.   
 
• Diluted earnings per ADS was RMB5.65 (US$0.80) and diluted earnings per share was 
RMB0.71 (US$0.10 or HK$0.78). Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS was RMB18.97 
(US$2.67), a decrease of 2% year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was 
RMB2.37 (US$0.33 or HK$2.62), a decrease of 2% year-over-year.

• Net cash provided by operating activities was RMB64,716 million (US$9,115 million), a decrease 
of 26% compared to RMB87,370 million in the same quarter of 2022. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP 
measurement of liquidity, was RMB56,540 million (US$7,963 million), a decrease of 31% compared 
to RMB81,514 million in the same quarter of 2022. The decrease in free cash flow was attributed to 
increased capex and several one-time factors including timing of income tax payments and working 
capital changes related to several of our businesses.  
 
BUSINESS AND STRATEGIC UPDATES 
 
Taobao and Tmall Group 
 
We are in the process of revitalizing Taobao and Tmall Group and positioning it for future growth. Our 
growth strategy is to put users first, build ecosystem for brands and merchants to thrive on our platform, and 
realize technology-driven innovation. We are committed to building an e-commerce ecosystem where 
brands, merchants and manufacturers operate with high efficiency, thereby providing multi-tiered Chinese 
consumers with good products and services at attractive prices. In December 2023, we appointed a new 
management team to execute Taobao and Tmall Group’s strategy and drive business growth through 
technological innovation. 
 
For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, revenue from Taobao and Tmall Group was RMB129,070 million 
(US$18,179 million), a growth of 2% year-over-year. During the quarter, online GMV achieved healthy 
growth year-over-year, with the number of transacting buyers and order volume growing strongly, partly 
offset by decrease in average order value. Under our user engagement and price-competitive strategies, we 
continued to increase interactive content and broaden the assortment of value-for-money products. 
Additionally, we continued our efforts to onboard a wider range of brands and merchants. The number of 
merchants operating on our platform during the quarter continued to grow at double digits year-over-year, 
and this double-digit growth trend has sustained over the past four quarters.  
 
Following a successful 11.11 Global Shopping Festival, order volume grew double digits year-over-year 
during the second half of the quarter. This reflected increasing consumer demand and willingness to make 
purchases on our platform driven by our price-competitive strategy.  
 
On the other hand, we have been successful in retaining and growing premium shoppers as the number of 
88VIP members continued to increase double digits year-over-year, surpassing 32 million.  
 
Cloud Intelligence Group 
 
For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, revenue from Cloud Intelligence Group was RMB28,066 million 
(US$3,953 million), a growth of 3% year-over-year. We continue to improve revenue quality by reducing 
the revenue from low-margin project-based contracts. On the other hand, revenue from public cloud 
products and services grew healthily which contributed to profitability improvement.  
 
Recent highlights of our proprietary products and technology include: 
 
• Elastic Compute: In January 2024, Alibaba Cloud unveiled its newest general-purpose ECS 
instance g8i, which significantly boosts overall performance and AI inferencing capabilities.   
 
• Database: In the 2023 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Cloud Database Management Systems 
report, Alibaba Cloud was named a Leader for the fourth year in a row.

Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group (“AIDC”) 
 
For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, revenue from AIDC grew 44% year-over-year to RMB28,516 
million (US$4,016 million), and the combined orders of AIDC grew 24% year-over-year. The strong 
performance was driven by solid growth across all of AIDC’s retail platforms, especially from the cross-
border AliExpress Choice business. Our cross-border businesses exhibited rapid year-over-year growth in 
response to increasing global demand for high-quality products at attractive prices. To sustain this 
momentum and provide differentiated services to customers, we increased investments during this quarter 
and will continue to invest in further growth. 
 
During the quarter, AliExpress delivered over 60% year-over-year order growth, driven by Choice, which 
provides an enhanced experience to consumers by combining better product selection, price and quality with 
speed of logistics and great customer support. Choice represented about half of AliExpress’ total orders in 
January 2024 and continues to deliver rapid order growth.   
 
During the quarter, Trendyol continued its robust double-digit order growth. While maintaining its leading 
e-commerce position in Türkiye, Trendyol has further extended its operations into the Middle East with a 
wide range of merchandise as well as speedy and reliable logistics experience.  
 
Lazada continues to focus on optimizing its operating efficiency. With further increased monetization and 
decreased logistics costs, Lazada’s loss per order continued to narrow year-over-year during the quarter. 
 
Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Limited (“Cainiao”) 
 
For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, revenue from Cainiao grew 24% year-over-year to RMB28,476 
million (US$4,011 million), primarily driven by revenue from cross-border fulfillment solutions. 
 
Cainiao continues to execute its strategy of building a global smart logistics network, reinforcing 
comprehensive end-to-end capabilities in first-mile pick-up, line haul, customs clearance, sortation, and last-
mile delivery. To support cross-border business development, with the upgrade of end-to-end capabilities, 
Cainiao further expanded its premium 5-day delivery service coverage, adding two more countries during 
the quarter. The order volume for the premium 5-day delivery service achieved robust triple-digit quarter-
over-quarter growth. 
 
Local Services Group 
 
For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, revenue from Local Services Group grew 13% year-over-year to 
RMB15,160 million (US$2,135 million), driven by healthy growth of Ele.me and rapid growth of Amap. 
During this quarter, order growth of Local Services Group exceeded 20% year-over-year. Local Services 
Group’s annual active consumers reached over 390 million and their annual purchasing frequency grew 
strongly year-over-year for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. For this quarter, its losses 
continued to narrow driven by improving business scale and efficiency.  
 
Digital Media and Entertainment Group 
 
During the quarter ended December 31, 2023, revenue of Digital Media and Entertainment Group was 
RMB5,040 million (US$710 million), an increase of 18% year-over-year, driven by strong revenue growth 
of offline entertainment businesses of Alibaba Pictures. During the quarter, Damai, a subsidiary of Alibaba 
Pictures, consolidated its industry-leading position by servicing almost all the major concerts in China, 
which contributed to rapid GMV growth year-over-year. Total box office of movies produced, promoted and 
distributed by Alibaba Pictures’ movie segment accounted for more than half of China’s total box office 
during the quarter.

Updates on ESG Initiatives  
 
Progress in Decarbonization 
 
We continue to accelerate our transition to clean energy. In November 2023, Bloomberg New Energy 
Finance released the “China's Top Clean Energy Buyers and Sellers in 2023.” Alibaba Group, with a green 
electricity transaction volume of 1,610 gigawatt-hours, became the national leader for green electricity 
procurement for the first time. 
 
In November 2023, Alibaba Group was the first Asian Internet technology company to join the World 
Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), a group of over 200 businesses, to support 
WBCSD’s drive to make global value chains more sustainable. At COP28, Alibaba Group together with 
WBCSD and other corporate members, advocated for “Scope 3+” carbon reduction actions by promoting the 
"Guidance on Avoided Emissions" report.   
 
Upsize of Share Repurchase Program 
 
As previously announced, during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased a total of 292.7 
million ordinary shares (equivalent of 36.6 million ADSs) for a total of US$2.9 billion, and a total of 897.9 
million ordinary shares (equivalent of 112.2 million ADSs) for a total of US$9.5 billion during the 2023 
calendar year. As of December 31, 2023, we had 20.0 billion ordinary shares (equivalent of 2.5 billion 
ADSs) outstanding. Our share repurchase program resulted in a net reduction of 3.3% in our outstanding 
shares in the 2023 calendar year after accounting for shares issued under our ESOP.  
 
Our board of directors has approved an increase of US$25 billion to our share repurchase program through 
the end of March 2027. Following this upsize, we currently have US$35.3 billion available under our share 
repurchase program through the next three fiscal years. We have undertaken to update investors on our share 
repurchases immediately after the end of each quarter with the next update expected to be published in early 
April.

(i)  
Segment revenue 
 
• China Commerce Retail Business  
 
Revenue from our China commerce retail business in the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was 
RMB123,762 million (US$17,432 million), an increase of 1% compared to RMB122,736 million in 
the same quarter of 2022.  
 
Customer management revenue remained stable year-over-year, primarily due to healthy growth in 
online GMV generated on Taobao and Tmall, excluding unpaid orders, partly offset by decline in 
overall take rate. The overall take rate decreased slightly year-over-year mainly because the increase 
in GMV came from Taobao merchants.   
 
Direct sales and others revenue under China commerce retail business in the quarter ended December 
31, 2023 was RMB31,649 million (US$4,458 million), an increase of 2% compared to RMB31,042 
million in the same quarter of 2022. 
 
• China Commerce Wholesale Business  
 
Revenue from our China commerce wholesale business in the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was 
RMB5,308 million (US$747 million), an increase of 23% compared to RMB4,329 million in the

million) in the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to RMB59,245 million in the same 
quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to narrowing losses in certain businesses, partly 
offset by an increase in investment in content, user acquisition and retention of Taobao app, as well 
as technological innovation.  
 
Cloud Intelligence Group 
 
(i)  
Segment revenue 
 
Revenue from Cloud Intelligence Group was RMB28,066 million (US$3,953 million) in the quarter 
ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 3% compared to RMB27,364 million in the same quarter 
of 2022. Year-over-year revenue growth was mainly driven by Alibaba-consolidated businesses. 
Revenue excluding Alibaba-consolidated businesses decreased year-over-year, primarily due to the 
decrease in revenue from low-margin project-based contracts as a result of continued effort to 
improve revenue quality. However, revenue from our public cloud products and services experienced 
healthy year-over-year growth.

the revenue contribution from AliExpress Choice as well as improvements in monetization. As 
certain of our international businesses generate revenue in local currencies while our reporting

value of the underlying awards and the quantity of awards we grant in the future.

goodwill of Youku.

investees.

Our net income in the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was RMB10,717 million (US$1,509 million),

from operations due to impairment, partly offset by an increase in impairment of intangible assets 
attributable to noncontrolling interests.

included in equity securities and other investments on the consolidated balance sheets, were RMB652,962

investments mainly comprise of investments in fixed deposits and certificates of deposits with original 
maturities over one year for treasury purposes. The increase in cash and cash equivalents, short-term

due to free cash flow generated from operations of RMB140,849 million (US$19,838 million), effect of 
exchange gain of RMB8,949 million (US$1,260 million) mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar

(US$463 million), partly offset by cash used in repurchase of ordinary shares of RMB54,731 million

2022. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measurement of liquidity, was RMB56,540 million (US$7,963 million), 
a decrease of 31% compared to RMB81,514 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The decrease 
in free cash flow was attributed to increased capex and several one-time factors including timing of income 
tax payments and working capital changes related to several of our businesses. A reconciliation of net cash 
provided by operating activities to free cash flow is included at the end of this results announcement. 
 
Net cash used in investing activities 
 
During the quarter ended December 31, 2023, net cash used in investing activities of RMB30,925 million 
(US$4,356 million) primarily reflected (i) an increase in other treasury investments by RMB14,559 million 
(US$2,051 million), (ii) capital expenditure of RMB8,857 million (US$1,247 million), (iii) an increase in 
short-term investments by RMB5,477 million (US$771 million), and (iv) cash outflow of RMB4,833 million 
(US$680 million) for investment and acquisition activities. These cash outflows were partially offset by cash 
inflow of RMB3,333 million (US$469 million) from disposal of investments.  
 
Net cash used in financing activities 
 
During the quarter ended December 31, 2023, net cash used in financing activities of RMB17,214 million 
(US$2,424 million) primarily reflected cash used in repurchase of ordinary shares of RMB20,706 million 
(US$2,916 million), partially offset by net proceeds from bank borrowings of RMB2,955 million (US$416 
million).

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  
 
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with 
GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: for our consolidated results, adjusted EBITDA 
(including adjusted EBITDA margin), adjusted EBITA (including adjusted EBITA margin), non-GAAP net 
income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share/ADS and free cash flow. For more information on these non-
GAAP financial measures, please refer to the table captioned “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures to 
the Nearest Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures” in this results announcement. 
 
We believe that adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted 
earnings per share/ADS help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be distorted by 
the effect of certain income or expenses that we include in income from operations, net income and diluted 
earnings per share/ADS. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about our 
core operating results, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and 
allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and 
operational decision-making. We present three different income measures, namely adjusted EBITDA, 
 
 
20 
 
 
 
adjusted EBITA and non-GAAP net income in order to provide more information and greater transparency 
to investors about our operating results.  
 
We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and 
investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used for strategic corporate 
transactions, including investing in our new business initiatives, making strategic investments and 
acquisitions and strengthening our balance sheet. 
 
Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share/ADS 
and free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to income from 
operations, net income, diluted earnings per share/ADS, cash flows or any other measure of performance or 
as an indicator of our operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here do not 
have standardized meanings prescribed by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled 
measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures 
differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to our data. 
 
Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest and investment income, net, interest expense, 
other income, net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity method investees, share-based 
compensation expense, amortization and impairment of intangible assets, depreciation and impairment of 
property and equipment, and operating lease cost relating to land use rights, impairment of goodwill, and 
others (including provision in relation to matters outside the ordinary course of business, as well as equity-
settled donation expense), which we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance during 
the periods presented. 
 
Adjusted EBITA represents net income before interest and investment income, net, interest expense, other 
income, net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity method investees, share-based compensation 
expense, amortization and impairment of intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, and others (including 
provision in relation to matters outside the ordinary course of business, as well as equity-settled donation 
expense), which we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance during the periods 
presented. 
 
Non-GAAP net income represents net income before share-based compensation expense, amortization and 
impairment of intangible assets, gain or loss on deemed disposals/disposals/revaluation of investments, 
impairment of goodwill and investments, and others (including provision in relation to matters outside the 
ordinary course of business, as well as equity-settled donation expense), and adjustments for the tax effects. 
 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share represents non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary 
shareholders divided by the weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares for computing non-
GAAP diluted earnings per share on a diluted basis. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS represents non-
GAAP diluted earnings per share after adjusting for the ordinary share-to-ADS ratio. 
 
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities as presented in our consolidated cash 
flow statement less purchases of property and equipment (excluding acquisition of land use rights and 
construction in progress relating to office campuses) and intangible assets (excluding those acquired through 
acquisitions), as well as adjustments to exclude from net cash provided by operating activities the buyer 
protection fund deposits from merchants on our marketplaces. We deduct certain items of cash flows from 
investing activities in order to provide greater transparency into cash flow from our revenue-generating 
business operations. We exclude “acquisition of land use rights and construction in progress relating to 
office campuses” because the office campuses are used by us for corporate and administrative purposes and 
are not directly related to our revenue-generating business operations. We also exclude buyer protection 
fund deposits from merchants on our marketplaces because these deposits are restricted for the purpose of 
compensating buyers for claims against merchants.

The table captioned “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures to the Nearest Comparable U.S. GAAP 
Measures” in this results announcement has more details on the non-GAAP financial measures that are most 
directly comparable to GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial 
measures.

(1) See the table above for the reconciliation of net income to non-GAAP net income for more information of these non-GAAP 
adjustments. 
(2) Each ADS represents eight ordinary shares. 
(3) Diluted earnings per share is derived from dividing net income attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average 
number of outstanding ordinary shares, on a diluted basis. Diluted earnings per ADS is derived from the diluted earnings per 
share after adjusting for the ordinary share-to-ADS ratio.   
(4) Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is derived from dividing non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders 
by the weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares for computing non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, on a 
diluted basis. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS is derived from the non-GAAP diluted earnings per share after adjusting 
for the ordinary share-to-ADS ratio.
