Hangzhou, China, February 7, 2024 – Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA and HKEX: 9988 
(HKD Counter) and 89988 (RMB Counter), “Alibaba” or “Alibaba Group”) today announced its financial 
results for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. 
“We delivered a solid quarter as we are executing our focused strategies across the organization. Our top 
priority is to reignite the growth of our core businesses, e-commerce and cloud computing. We will step up 
investment to improve users’ core experiences to drive growth in Taobao and Tmall Group and strengthen 
market leadership in the coming year. We will also focus our resources on developing public cloud products 
and sustaining the strong growth momentum in international commerce business,” said Eddie Wu, Chief 
Executive Officer of Alibaba Group.  
“Alibaba Group delivered a healthy quarter with revenue growth of 5% year-over-year. We increased our 
investment in strategic priorities and improved shareholder return by leveraging our strong balance sheet and 
cash flow. Our board of directors approved an increase of US$25 billion to our share repurchase program, 
demonstrating our confidence in the outlook of our business and cash flow. Our consistent share repurchase 
has also reduced outstanding share count while achieving EPS and cash flow per share accretion,” said Toby 
Xu, Chief Financial Officer of Alibaba Group. 
BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS  
 
In the quarter ended December 31, 2023: 
• Revenue was RMB260,348 million (US$36,669 million), an increase of 5% year-over-year.   
 
• Income from operations was RMB22,511 million (US$3,171 million), a decrease of 36% year-
over-year. The year-over-year decrease was primarily attributable to impairment of intangible assets 
of Sun Art and impairment of goodwill of Youku. Adjusted EBITA, a non-GAAP measurement 
(excluding share-based compensation expense, impairment of intangible assets and goodwill and 
certain other items), increased 2% year-over-year to RMB52,843 million (US$7,443 million).  
 
• Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was RMB14,433 million (US$2,033 million). 
Net income was RMB10,717 million (US$1,509 million), a decrease of 77% or RMB35,029 million 
year-over-year, primarily attributable to mark-to-market changes from our equity investments and 
the decrease in income from operations due to the impairment as mentioned above. Excluding share-
based compensation expense, gains/losses of investments, impairment of intangible assets and 
goodwill, and certain other items, non-GAAP net income in the quarter ended December 31, 2023 
was RMB47,951 million (US$6,754 million), a decrease of 4% compared to RMB49,932 million in 
the same quarter of 2022.

measurement of liquidity, was RMB56,540 million (US$7,963 million), a decrease of 31% compared

increased capex and several one-time factors including timing of income tax payments and working 
capital changes related to several of our businesses.  
 
BUSINESS AND STRATEGIC UPDATES 
 
Taobao and Tmall Group 
 
We are in the process of revitalizing Taobao and Tmall Group and positioning it for future growth. Our 
growth strategy is to put users first, build ecosystem for brands and merchants to thrive on our platform, and 
realize technology-driven innovation. We are committed to building an e-commerce ecosystem where 
brands, merchants and manufacturers operate with high efficiency, thereby providing multi-tiered Chinese 
consumers with good products and services at attractive prices. In December 2023, we appointed a new 
management team to execute Taobao and Tmall Group’s strategy and drive business growth through 
technological innovation. 
 
For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, revenue from Taobao and Tmall Group was RMB129,070 million 
(US$18,179 million), a growth of 2% year-over-year. During the quarter, online GMV achieved healthy 
growth year-over-year, with the number of transacting buyers and order volume growing strongly, partly 
offset by decrease in average order value. Under our user engagement and price-competitive strategies, we 
continued to increase interactive content and broaden the assortment of value-for-money products. 
Additionally, we continued our efforts to onboard a wider range of brands and merchants. The number of 
merchants operating on our platform during the quarter continued to grow at double digits year-over-year, 
and this double-digit growth trend has sustained over the past four quarters.  
 
Following a successful 11.11 Global Shopping Festival, order volume grew double digits year-over-year 
during the second half of the quarter. This reflected increasing consumer demand and willingness to make 
purchases on our platform driven by our price-competitive strategy.  
 
On the other hand, we have been successful in retaining and growing premium shoppers as the number of 
88VIP members continued to increase double digits year-over-year, surpassing 32 million.  
 
Cloud Intelligence Group 
 
For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, revenue from Cloud Intelligence Group was RMB28,066 million 
(US$3,953 million), a growth of 3% year-over-year. We continue to improve revenue quality by reducing 
the revenue from low-margin project-based contracts. On the other hand, revenue from public cloud 
products and services grew healthily which contributed to profitability improvement.  
 
Recent highlights of our proprietary products and technology include: 
 
• Elastic Compute: In January 2024, Alibaba Cloud unveiled its newest general-purpose ECS 
instance g8i, which significantly boosts overall performance and AI inferencing capabilities.   
 
• Database: In the 2023 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Cloud Database Management Systems
